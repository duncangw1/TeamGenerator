## Description

The purpose of the Team Generator is to allow a manager to easily create an HTML page that displays their team's basic information. This is a command-line application that dynamically generates an HTML file from the users input. The technologies utilized to make this possible are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest. Once invoked, the user will be prompted to enter the Manager's info (name, ID, email, office number) and then choose which type of employee they would like to add next. The options are either an Engineer (name, ID, email, Github) or an Intern (name, ID, email, school). The user can add as many or as few employees as they would like. When the user decides they are finished, the application will generate an HTML page that displays their team in a professional way.
